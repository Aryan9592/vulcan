# Modules

Modules are a key component of `Vulcan`. Each module is designed to handle one specific part of your
testing or scripting problems. For example, the [`accounts`](./accounts.md) module includes
utilities to interact and modify external owned accounts or contracts while the
[`watchers`](./watchers.md) module provide tools to monitor contracts calls and events.
