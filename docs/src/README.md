Vulcan is a development framework for Foundry projects.

Initially, Vulcan will provide functionality similar to what is included in the core VM and forge-std, but focusing on readability and developer experience. Over time, Vulcan will grow to include more functionality and utilities, eventually becoming a full-featured development framework.
